Normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) shows “how green,” NDMI adds “how wet.” So two areas may have similar greenness in some spots, 
but different water status, which matters a lot for biomass/forage productivity and drought stress interpretation.

From the study areas of the map it can be infered that: NDMI maps indicate generally higher canopy moisture in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread low/negative NDMI values, 
suggesting drier vegetation conditions and stronger moisture stress.
