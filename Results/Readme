## MSAVI-Based Vegetation Change Analysis (2020–2025)

All 3 indices gave similar results, therefore I continued to use only MSAVI index for the change analysis.
The main objective was to assess changes in vegetation condition in Gakh and Yardimli for the summer pastures.

### MSAVI Change Distribution in Gakh 

![MSAVI change in Gakh (2020–2025)](figures/msavi_change_gakh.)

Due to the presence of high mountainous terrain, only areas above **1750 m** elevation were considered.
The results indicate a noticeable decrease in MSAVI values, suggesting vegetation degradation.

### MSAVI Change Distribution in Yardimli 

![MSAVI change in Yardimli (2020–2025)](figures/msavi_change_yardimli.png)

For Yardimli, areas above **1000 m** elevation were analyzed.
A similar degradation pattern can be observed.

### Comparison of the change in area of regions

Although vegetation degradation was detected in both regions, the mean MSAVI 
decline was lower in Yardimli than in Gakh.
Elevation-related environmental differences may contribute to this pattern.
