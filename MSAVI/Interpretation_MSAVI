Modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) is like NDVI but more stable when soil is visible (it reduces soil background effect). 
So it’s very useful for sparse vegetation / pasture / semi-bare areas.

Based on the study areas of the map, we can concur

Gakh - Large parts are green (high MSAVI) → denser and more continuous vegetation cover. 
The orange/red zones are mostly in the southern/lower parts and along some linear features, 
indicating sparser vegetation or more exposed soil.

Yardimli - More orange/red overall with patchy green areas → vegetation is generally more 
sparse and mixed with bare soil/rock, which is typical for rugged terrain and drier pasture conditions.
The greener patches likely correspond to moister valleys / better pasture pockets / north-facing slopes.

MSAVI highlights stronger, more continuous vegetation cover in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread 
low-to-moderate MSAVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and greater soil/background influence typical 
of mountain pastures.
