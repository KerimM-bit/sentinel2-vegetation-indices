# Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the extraction and visualization of vegetation
indices (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI) from Sentinel-2 imagery using Google Earth Engine,
with a focus on agricultural land monitoring specificly for summer pastures.

## Data
- Sentinel-2 L2A
- Study areas: Gakh and Yardimli mountanious regions
- Time period: 09-2020 - 10-2020

## Methodology
- Cloud masking
- Index calculation (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI)
- Export of raster outputs from Google Earth Engine
- Visualization and interpretation

## Results
### NDVI

### MSAVI

### NDMI

## Interpretation
- NDVI highlights general vegetation vigor
- MSAVI reduces soil background influence in sparse vegetation
- NDMI reflects vegetation moisture conditions

## Tools
- Google Earth Engine
- Python / GIS software for visualization

## Notes
This repository focuses on analysis outputs and interpretation rather than
full automation code.

Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) mainly separates “green vs non-green,” Modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) improves separation in sparse pasture where soil is visible, and Normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) helps distinguish truly productive biomass from “green but dry/stressed” vegetation. So using all three together did give us cleaner biomass classes and reduce confusion between bare soil, sparse grassland, and dense/moist vegetation.
