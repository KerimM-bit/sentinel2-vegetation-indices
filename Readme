# Sentinel-2 Vegetation Indices (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI).

## Overview
This project demonstrates the extraction and visualization of vegetation
indices (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI) from Sentinel-2 imagery using Google Earth Engine,
with a focus on agricultural land monitoring specificly for summer pastures.

## Data
- Sentinel-2 L2A
- Study areas: Gakh and Yardimli mountanious regions
- Time period: 2025

## Methodology
- Cloud masking
- Index calculation (NDVI, MSAVI, NDMI)
- Export of raster outputs from Google Earth Engine
- Visualization and interpretation

## Results
### NDVI

*Figure 1. Comparison of NDVI Values in Gakh and Yardimli, Azerbaijan (2025).*

High NDVI  (green) indicates dense, healthy vegetation—mainly forested or well-vegetated mountainous zones.
Low NDVI (red–orange) reflects sparse vegetation, bare soil, degraded pasture, or built-up areas.

Gakh shows larger and more continuous high-NDVI zones, suggesting denser vegetation cover and better moisture conditions, consistent with its higher elevation and forest influence.
Yardimli exhibits more fragmented and lower NDVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and stronger topographic or climatic stress, typical of mountainous pasture-dominated landscapes.

NDVI patterns closely follow topography and land use: valleys and forested slopes show higher NDVI, while ridges, steep slopes, and open grazing areas show lower values.
This spatial variability suggests NDVI is sensitive to elevation, moisture availability, and vegetation type, making it suitable for biomass and pasture-condition analysis in both regions.

### MSAVI

MSAVI is like NDVI but more stable when soil is visible (it reduces soil background effect). 
So it’s very useful for sparse vegetation / pasture / semi-bare areas.

Based on the study areas of the map, we can concur

Gakh - Large parts are green (high MSAVI) → denser and more continuous vegetation cover. 
The orange/red zones are mostly in the southern/lower parts and along some linear features, 
indicating sparser vegetation or more exposed soil.

Yardimli - More orange/red overall with patchy green areas → vegetation is generally more 
sparse and mixed with bare soil/rock, which is typical for rugged terrain and drier pasture conditions.
The greener patches likely correspond to moister valleys / better pasture pockets / north-facing slopes.

MSAVI highlights stronger, more continuous vegetation cover in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread 
low-to-moderate MSAVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and greater soil/background influence typical 
of mountain pastures.

### NDMI

*Figure 3. Comparison of NDMI Values in Gakh and Yardimli, Azerbaijan (2025).*

NDMI shows “how green,” NDMI adds “how wet.” So two areas may have similar greenness in some spots, 
but different water status, which matters a lot for biomass/forage productivity and drought stress interpretation.

From the study areas of the map it can be infered that: NDMI maps indicate generally higher canopy moisture in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread low/negative NDMI values, 
suggesting drier vegetation conditions and stronger moisture stress.

## Interpretation
- NDVI highlights general vegetation vigor
- MSAVI reduces soil background influence in sparse vegetation
- NDMI reflects vegetation moisture conditions

## Tools
- Google Earth Engine
- Python / GIS software for visualization

## Notes
This repository focuses on analysis outputs and interpretation rather than
full automation code.
