## Normalized difference vegetation index
High NDVI  (green) indicates dense, healthy vegetation—mainly forested or well-vegetated mountainous zones.
Low NDVI (red–orange) reflects sparse vegetation, bare soil, degraded pasture, or built-up areas.

Gakh shows larger and more continuous high-NDVI zones, suggesting denser vegetation cover and better moisture conditions, consistent with its higher elevation and forest influence.
Yardimli exhibits more fragmented and lower NDVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and stronger topographic or climatic stress, typical of mountainous pasture-dominated landscapes.

NDVI patterns closely follow topography and land use: valleys and forested slopes show higher NDVI, while ridges, steep slopes, and open grazing areas show lower values.
This spatial variability suggests NDVI is sensitive to elevation, moisture availability, and vegetation type, making it suitable for biomass and pasture-condition analysis in both regions.


## Modified soil adjusted vegetation index
MSAVI is like NDVI but more stable when soil is visible (it reduces soil background effect). 
So it’s very useful for sparse vegetation / pasture / semi-bare areas.

Based on the study areas of the map, we can concur

Gakh - Large parts are green (high MSAVI) → denser and more continuous vegetation cover. 
The orange/red zones are mostly in the southern/lower parts and along some linear features, 
indicating sparser vegetation or more exposed soil.

Yardimli - More orange/red overall with patchy green areas → vegetation is generally more 
sparse and mixed with bare soil/rock, which is typical for rugged terrain and drier pasture conditions.
The greener patches likely correspond to moister valleys / better pasture pockets / north-facing slopes.

MSAVI highlights stronger, more continuous vegetation cover in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread 
low-to-moderate MSAVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and greater soil/background influence typical 
of mountain pastures.


## Normalized difference moisture index
NDMI shows “how green,” NDMI adds “how wet.” So two areas may have similar greenness in some spots, 
but different water status, which matters a lot for biomass/forage productivity and drought stress interpretation.

From the study areas of the map it can be infered that: NDMI maps indicate generally higher canopy moisture in Gakh, while Yardimli shows more widespread low/negative NDMI values, 
suggesting drier vegetation conditions and stronger moisture stress.
