1. Vegetation condition contrast
High Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)  (green) indicates dense, healthy vegetation—mainly forested or well-vegetated mountainous zones.
Low NDVI (red–orange) reflects sparse vegetation, bare soil, degraded pasture, or built-up areas.

2. Spatial differences between study areas
Gakh shows larger and more continuous high-NDVI zones, suggesting denser vegetation cover and better moisture conditions, consistent with its higher elevation and forest influence.
Yardimli exhibits more fragmented and lower NDVI values, indicating sparser vegetation and stronger topographic or climatic stress, typical of mountainous pasture-dominated landscapes.

3. Environmental controls
NDVI patterns closely follow topography and land use: valleys and forested slopes show higher NDVI, while ridges, steep slopes, and open grazing areas show lower values.
This spatial variability suggests NDVI is sensitive to elevation, moisture availability, and vegetation type, making it suitable for biomass and pasture-condition analysis in both regions.
